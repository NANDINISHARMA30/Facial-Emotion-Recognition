# Facial Emotion Recognition 😄😢😠😲

This project implements a **Facial Emotion Recognition System** using deep learning . It detects facial expressions in real-time and classifies them into seven basic emotions: *Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise,* and *Neutral*. Ideal for emotion-aware applications like virtual assistants, mental health monitoring, and interactive systems.
